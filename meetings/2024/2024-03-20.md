  - we need a written policy regarding this.  also needed for TC54.  convenors will work with DE/Ecma/TC54 on this.
  - need a place for hosting recordings

### `Array.isTemplateObject()` / Trusted Types

- Useful for Trusted Types, which may soon ship cross-browser
- [Old hold-up](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-is-template-object/issues/10)
- [Recent history](https://github.com/w3c/trusted-types/issues/398)

### contributors to TC/TG need to sign RFTG agreement, etc

- Ecma has some TODOs here
  - possibly need IE, not sure
  - DE: same policies should apply to outside collaborators
  - DE: not sure who has signed agreements, we have a TC form, Ecma has another form

### TG3 meeting on public calendar?

- can we add to public calendar?
  - yes
- should invite list be private?
  - no objections to public
  - need to ask DPV
