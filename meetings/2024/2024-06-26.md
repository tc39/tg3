### structs discussion, post-plenary debrief

from delegates chat during/after plenary:

(from that chat) RBN: Do we, as a committee, think JS privacy is a security feature? Would it be unforgivable if private state isn't really private at the realm boundary? If we could have struct S { #x; ... } in realm A mapped to struct S { x; ... } in realm B, would we consider that a security vulnerability?

(from that chat) CDA: yes, yes, and yes

TG3 agrees

(from that chat) RBN: If privacy is an important security concern, then you must have an unforgeable correlation mechanism. Auto-correlation by source location is unforgeable.
