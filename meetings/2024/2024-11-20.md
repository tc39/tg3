## Agenda

- (Nic) `import defer` follow-up
  - We have deferred an answer whether to expose a symbol-named accessor that indicates whether the underlying module has evaluated until after Mark explains interaction with stability traits.
- (Nic) ShadowRealm global object: question about the ordinary object requirement
  - We resolved that non-observable difference between a global object and an ordinary object is consistent with the 262 portion of the specification.
- (Mark) Stabilize dry-run
