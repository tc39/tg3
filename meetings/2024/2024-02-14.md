### [WasmGC shared memory proposal][wasm] / [shared structs proposal][structs] / [convergence][convergence]

MM:

- does not want shared mem multi-threading in JS
- dangerous for engine integrity
- concurrent GC dangerous for engine integrity
- will discuss concerns at upcoming structs mtg
- also: general issue of JS as a language to support defensive programming, integrity protection

  - shared mem multithreading difficult to defend, not a that supports interaction of components, whereas comm event loops does support
  - related: <https://papers.agoric.com/papers/concurrency-among-strangers/abstract/>

- structs mtg tomorrow at 18:00 UTC
  - MM, others attending

ACTION: CDA, invite SYG to TG3 to discuss, also ask for new version of proposal referenced in slides (splitting into MVP for WASM convergence)

JHD: us govt requirements suggest that in near future, memory-unsafe languages will be forbidden in any products/services consumed

- <https://media.defense.gov/2023/Dec/06/2003352724/-1/-1/0/THE-CASE-FOR-MEMORY-SAFE-ROADMAPS-TLP-CLEAR.PDF>

related: overwhelming majority of all security vulns are caused by memory safety issues

CDA: recommendation for proposals repo: presentation history

- need to better understand the split of the TC39 structs proposal re: MVP for WASM proposal convergence/delivery/ask for stage 2 at TC39
