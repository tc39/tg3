## Agenda

NRO and JMN presented a proposal for numeric-with-precision that decouples the concern of communicating a number with precision to Intl APIs from the Decimal, which allows Decimal.prototype to be a suitable future home for a boxed single-dimensional decimal primitive and more generally solves the problem for representing numbers with precision, including ordinary floating point numbers.

NRO asked this group about how to settle a conflict in the interactions between CSP, dynamic import, and eval, and dynamic scope. Participants present are generally averse to dynamic scope and no proponents of dynamic scope for purposes of CSP 'dynamic eval' (to tap the transcript for the exact term) were present, so we resolved to reach out to those proponents rather than express a premature opinion.
