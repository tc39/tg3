## Agenda

structs mtg is tomorrow

### Decimal

NRO: MM said if have equality for decimal as objects that ignores the canonicalized... -- makes it impossible to have decimal as a primitive in the future.

- when working on R&T, had impression we reached agreement on having a primitive that doesn't have that property
how much do we care if primitives are equal...
MM: with R&T we tried hard to compromise but the issues around various equalities, primitive equality vs 0 -1, nested zeroes, NaN.  lots of friction, reluctance to move forward.
agreed that primitive equality if typeof a is b then if a==b that must mean a===b
MM: I don't distinguish between canonicalize vs normalize
NRO: proposal doesn't currently have semantics for primitive behavior

### MM: immutable arraybuffer proposal, taking to October plenary

PHE signed on as co-champion

### NRO: looking at adding `ArrayBuffer.prototype.transferToShared()`
