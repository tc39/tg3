## Meeting

GRS: Michael Ficarra put the only agenda item for this meeting. He is unable to make it to this meeting, so the agenda item has been bumped to the January meeting.

MM: For a future meeting, when Shu can attend, I propose we discuss whether the “structs” proposal (for Java-like shared-memory multi-threading) raises exactly the hazard that it make it much harder for implementations to maintain their security, i.e., that makes it too likely that implementations fail to implement the structs proposal correctly, thereby introducing security flaws.

GRS: I propose that we end the meeting early unless there are any additional items that we would like to discuss today.

- Consensus on adjourning the meeting early

GRS: Adjourned the meeting.
