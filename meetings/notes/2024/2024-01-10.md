| a missing language invariant that is already checked by proxy and regular object steps | MAH |
| question about meeting scheduling | MM |

## missing language invariant

If a property is not configurable, getters and setters should never change, but this is not an invariant that constrains hosts (JS code would be unable to violate it).

MM confirms this was an unintentional omission, and considers it a spec bug.

MAH will make the spec PR, no tests should be needed.

## should we have fewer meetings, or only schedule TG3 meetings once there is an agenda?

MAH in favor of requiring an agenda 24 hours ahead, in order to have a meeting.

CM thinks perhaps we should be working harder to get items on the agenda.

CDA points out there's a sizable backlog.

Consensus to:

- cancel TG3 meeting if no agenda items 24 hours prior
- strive to pull from backlog so that there is an agenda
- revisit in future when backlog and agenda both are remaining empty
