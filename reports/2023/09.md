# 2023 September Plenary Report

this is a shortlist of items to report to TG1

if there are materials being presented at plenary, it would be good to add a link here

## Updates

- reminder of TG3 meeting times (copy from [README](/README.md))
- first meetings focused on reviewing prior agenda items and populating [the backlog](/meetings/agendas/backlog.md)
- discussed vulnerability disclosure policies and processes (ongoing)
  - note this is explicitly in TG3 scope/charter

## Items Seeking Committee Feedback and/or Consensus

- TG3 achieved consensus on the following items and is seeking consensus from TG1:
  - TC39 will accept vulnerability disclosures (and will have only one central endpoint for reports)
    - consensus?
  - TC39 will use the GH vulnerability disclosure feature
    - consensus?
  - The individuals who will have access to the reports are only the chairs and the TC39 administrator (JHD).  The reasons for this are:
    - responsible vulnerability disclosure policy means good InfoSec, which means keeping this information as private as possible until it can be responsibly disclosed to the public
    - if we use GH for vulnerability disclosure, the owners of the TC39 GH org will necessarily have access to this information anyway (no way around that)
    - the chairs and administrator have already been delegated increased responsibility from TC39
    - other relevant individuals will be pulled in only as necessary, and consistent with our vulnerability disclosure policy (policy still TBD)
    - consensus?
  - TC39 will maintain an inventory of security focals and reporting addresses for expected organizations (e.g. JS engine vendors) to assist in rapid response where needed, consistent with our vulnerability disclosure policy
    consensus?
